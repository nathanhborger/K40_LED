# K40_LED
LED Ring Origin Light for K40 Laser.
This device was designed with the intention to provide a solution to the K40's lack of origin detection/positioning.
Placed at the back of the laser, and reflected through two mirrors, the light will shine on the working peice, making a very distinct appearance which simplifies and enables the user to identify the exact locatino of the laser head.
